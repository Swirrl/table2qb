# table2qb

This project provides the first of a two step process for building rdf-cubes from tabular statistics: a preparatory transformation that converts a tidy csv (one row per observation) into several csv-on-the-web resources that may be translated into rdf using a csv2rdf processor.

For more information please see the [requirements](./requirements.md). the [proposed architecture](./architecture.md) and the [minimum non-trivial example](./minimum-example.md). There is also a more involved [ons trade example](../examples/ons-trade).
