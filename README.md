[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Swirrl/table2qb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/Swirrl/table2qb)

## Build Statistical Linked-Data with CSV-on-the-Web

Create statistical linked-data by deriving CSV-on-the-Web annotations for your data tables using the [RDF Data Cube Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/).

Build up a knowledge graph from spreadsheets without advanced programming skills or RDF modelling knowledge.

Simply prepare CSV inputs according to the templates and `table2qb` will output standards-compliant CSVW or RDF.

Once you're happy with the results you can adjust the configuration to tailor the URI patterns to your heart's content.

## Turn Data Tables into Data Cubes 

Table2qb expects three types of CSV tables as input:

- observations: a ['tidy data'](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) table with one statistic per row (what the standard calls an _observation_)
- components: another table defining the columns used to describe observations (what the standard calls _component properties_ such as _dimensions_, _measures_, and _attributes_)
- codelists: a further set of tables that enumerate and describe the values used in cells of the observation table (what the standard calls _codes_, grouped into _codelists_)

For example, [the ONS says](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/january2021) that:

> In mid-2019, the population of the UK reached an estimated 66.8 million

This is a single observation value (66.8 million) with two dimensions (date and place) which respectively have two code values (mid-2019 and UK), a single measure (population estimate), and implicitly an attribute for the unit (people).

The [regional-trade example](https://github.com/Swirrl/table2qb/tree/master/examples/regional-trade) goes into more depth. The [colour-coded spreadsheet](https://github.com/Swirrl/table2qb/blob/master/examples/regional-trade/all-colour-coded.ods) should help illustrate how the three types of table come together to describe a cube.

Each of these inputs is processed by it's own pipeline which will output [CSVW](https://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/) - i.e. a processed version of the CSV table along with a JSON metadata annotation which describes the translation into RDF. Optionally you can also ask `table2qb` to perform the translation outputting RDF directly that can be loaded into a graph database and queried with SPARQL.

Table2qb also relies on a fourth CSV table for configuration:

- columns: this describes how the observations table should be interpreted - i.e. which components and codelists should be used for each column in the observation tables

This configuration is designed to be used for multiple data cubes across a data collection (so that you can re-use e.g. a "Year" column without having to configure anew it each time) to encourage harmonisation and alignment of identifiers.

Ultimately `table2qb` provides a foundation to help you build a collection of interoperable statistical linked open data.

## Install table2qb

### Github release

Download the release from [https://github.com/Swirrl/table2qb/releases](https://github.com/Swirrl/table2qb/releases). 

Currently the latest is 0.3.0.

Once downloaded, unzip.  The main 'table2qb' executable is in the directory `./target/table2qb-0.3.0` You can add this directory to your `PATH` environment variable, or just run it with the full file path on your system.

To get help on the available commands, type `table2qb help`.

To see the available pipelines (described in more detail below), type `table2qb list`.

To see the required command structure for one of the pipelines (for example the cube-pipeline), type `table2qb describe cube-pipeline`

### Clojure CLI

Clojure now distributes `clojure` and `cli` command-line programs for running clojure programs. To run `table2qb` through the `clojure` command, first
[install the Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started). Then create a file `deps.edn` containing the following:   

**deps.edn**
```clojure
{:deps {swirrl/table2qb {:git/url "https://github.com/Swirrl/table2qb.git"
                         :sha "8c4b22778db0c160b06f2f3b0b3df064d8f8452b"}
        org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-api {:mvn/version "2.17.1"}
        org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core {:mvn/version "2.17.1"}
        org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-slf4j-impl {:mvn/version "2.17.1"}}
 :aliases
 {:table2qb
  {:main-opts ["-m" "table2qb.main"]}}}
```

You can then run `table2qb` using

    clojure -A:table2qb
    
More details about the `clojure` CLI and the format of the `deps.edn` file can be found [on the Clojure website](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli)

## Compiling table2qb

Table2qb is written in Clojure and can be built using [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). It is recommended you use [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) or later.

`table2qb` can be run through `leiningen` with `lein run` e.g.

    lein run list
    
Alternatively it can be run from an uberjar built with `lein uberjar`. The resulting .jar file in the `target` directory can then be run:

    java -jar target/table2qb.jar list

## How to run table2qb

See [using table2qb](doc/usage.md) for documentation on how to generate RDF data cubes using `table2qb`.

## Example

The [./examples/employment](./examples/employment) directory provides an example of creating a data cube from scratch with `table2qb`.
