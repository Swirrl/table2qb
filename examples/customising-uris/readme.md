# Customising URIs

This example shows how to use the URI template configuration to create custom URIs.

The data is designed to match the "[kubus luchtemissies](https://id.milieuinfo.be/imjv/kubus/luchtemissies#id)" (Air Emissions cube) from Belgium's Department of Environment, Nature and Energy. This linked-data involves several URI patterns that differ from the conventions built into table2qb.

The example includes a [script to call table2qb](./generate_example.sh) and generate the rdf output.
